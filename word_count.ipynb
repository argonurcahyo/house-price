      "(17) Introduction\n",
      "(121) Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are designated areas aimed at stimulating economic growth through targeted industrial activities and policies. SEZs in Indonesia are governed by Law No. 39 of 2009 on Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus, which provides a framework for incentivized economic development by offering fiscal and non-fiscal benefits to boost investment and Indonesia’s economy. This policy integrates strategic economic objectives, including reducing logistical inefficiencies, fostering industry clusters, and promoting foreign and domestic investments. The development SEZ in Indonesia covers 24 SEZs, including tourism, health, education, and industrial themes. This essay aims to evaluate the policy of Gresik SEZ, an advanced industrial cluster towards regional development.\n",
      "(287) Gresik SEZ, established under Government Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah) No. 71 of 2021, represents a high-performing industrial zone in East Java. Spanning 2,167 hectares, it specializes in high-technology industries, metal processing, chemical manufacturing, and logistics, leveraging its strategic location near Tanjung Perak Port (Dewan Nasional KEK, 2023). The SEZ has attracted significant investments, including PT Freeport Indonesia's smelter facility, Xinyi Glass, and Nippon Indosari (Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, 2023). Gresik is developed based on export-oriented industries to reduce dependency on raw material exports through industrial downstream. Gresik is the highest contributor to investment in Indonesia, with the achievement of realized investments reaching IDR 71.5 trillion by the end of 2023. The realization in labor absorption also reached a total of 32,000 workers, with 11,573 added in 2023. Currently, the development of Smelter PT. Freeport has already finished and start operating in October 2024. Further infrastructure development, such as residential areas, hospitals, and supporting infrastructure, strengthen the impact of Gresik SEZ in the Gerbangkertosusila Metropolitan Area and East Java Regions.\n",
      "(456) Gresik SEZ stands as a benchmark for industrial policy in Indonesia, representing Indonesia's broader strategy for economic transformation through value-added manufacturing and export-driven growth. Located in a strategic position for a Deep-sea port, Gresik SEZ will become a hub for logistics and shipping, connecting Eastern Indonesia and Foreign countries. With a focus on industrial downstream, plans include expanding manufacturing capabilities, such as solar glass production by Xinyi Glass, alongside strengthening existing sectors like metal processing, chemicals, and logistics (Dewan Nasional KEK, 2023). Infrastructure improvements are central to this vision, including the development of integrated utilities, advanced logistics facilities, and improved connectivity through road expansions and direct toll access. To address workforce and preparation for future labor absorption, Gresik needs to overlook skill gaps through partnerships with educational institutions and vocational training programs. Environmental sustainability is also prominent, with initiatives to adopt green industrial practices and implement ecological conservation measures. These strategic advancements aim to attract further investments, boost employment opportunities, and strengthen Gresik SEZ’s status as Indonesia’s industrial benchmark.\n",
      "(463) Overview of Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Policy\n",
      "(467) SEZ Policy in Indonesia \n",
      "(475) Special Economic Zone Act (Undang-Undang Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus)\n",
      "(633) The provisions regarding Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are regulated under Law No. 39 of 2009 on Special Economic Zone (Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus), which serves as the legal basis for SEZs. The origins of this regulation can be traced back to Article 31 of Law No. 25 of 2007 on Investment (Penanaman Modal), in Chapter XIV regarding Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus. This formed the foundation for the enactment of Law No. 39 of 2009 on Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus. The law governs the functions, forms, and criteria of SEZs, their establishment, infrastructure financing, institutional structures, goods traffic, quarantine, and foreign exchange, as well as the facilities and benefits provided. SEZs are designated areas within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Indonesia established to facilitate economic functions and to provide specific benefits. Their primary purpose is to foster and develop businesses in sectors such as trade, services, industry, mining and energy, transportation, maritime and fisheries, post and telecommunications, tourism, and other fields.\n",
      "(842) In line with this purpose, SEZs consist of one or more zones, including export processing zones, logistics zones, industrial zones, technology development zones, tourism zones, and energy zones. Activities within these zones may target both export and domestic markets. To qualify as an SEZ, a region must meet specific criteria, such as alignment with the Regional Spatial Plan, no disruption to protected areas, support from provincial/district/municipal governments for SEZ management, strategic location or potential in marine and fisheries, plantation, mining, or tourism resources, and clear boundaries, whether natural or artificial. The establishment of SEZs requires certain stages and conditions to be fulfilled. The first stage is the Proposal Stage, where the SEZ can be proposed by business entities, district/city governments, or provincial governments. Proposals must meet specified criteria, including development location maps and the proposed area size separate from residential areas, a spatial plan for the SEZ accompanied by zoning regulations, financing plans, and sources, environmental impact analyses in compliance with legislation, economic and financial feasibility studies, the intended duration of the SEZ, and strategic plans. These proposals are submitted to the National Council, which can approve or reject them. However, the government may directly designate a region as an SEZ without going through the proposal process if necessary.\n",
      "(1070) To operate an SEZ, institutional structures are established, comprising a National Council at the central level and Regional Councils at the provincial level. The National Council may form a Secretariat to assist with its work, while Regional Councils establish SEZ Administrators in each zone to manage services, supervision, and operational control. Business activities within SEZs are carried out by SEZ Managing Entities and Business Operators, which may include State-Owned Enterprises, Regional-Owned Enterprises, cooperatives, private businesses, or joint ventures involving private entities and/or cooperatives with the government and/or provincial/district/city governments. The facilities provided in SEZs aim to enhance competitiveness and attract investors. These include fiscal facilities, such as tax incentives, customs and excise benefits, regional taxes, and retribution exemptions, as well as non-fiscal facilities, such as land-use rights, licensing, immigration, investment, and labor-related benefits. Other facilities may be granted to zones within SEZs, subject to regulations by relevant authorities following applicable laws. Examples of these facilities include income tax incentives for businesses operating in SEZs, specific tax reductions for investors, such as exemptions on Land and Building Tax for a set period, suspension of import duties, excise exemptions for raw materials and production aids, Value Added Tax and Luxury Goods Tax exemptions for taxable goods and import income tax relief. Businesses in SEZs may also receive exemptions or reductions on regional taxes and retributions in line with prevailing regulations.\n",
      "(1070) \n",
      "(1082) Figure 1. The Development of Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Policy and Regulation\n",
      "(1088) Job Creation Act (Undang-Undang Cipta Kerja)\n",
      "(1260) Over time, Law No. 39 of 2009 on Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus underwent several amendments, including the introduction of Law No. 11 of 2020 on Cipta Kerja, which was subsequently revised into Government Regulation in place of Law No. 2 of 2022 on Cipta Kerja. This regulation was later formalized into Law No. 6 of 2023 concerning the enactment of Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 2 of 2022 as a Law. Key changes include the restructuring of SEZs based on business activities rather than zones. SEZs now encompass sectors such as production and processing, logistics and distribution, technology development, tourism, education, health, energy, and other economic activities. Specifically, education and health-related business activities require approval from the Central Government. The criteria for designating an area as an SEZ were also revised. These criteria now include alignment with the Regional Spatial Plan, ensuring no potential disruption to protected areas, clear boundaries (either natural or artificial), and a minimum of 50% of the proposed land area being already controlled, either partially or fully. \n",
      "(1446) The requirements for establishing SEZs have also been updated. The first step remains the Proposal Stage. At this stage, SEZ proposals can be submitted by business entities, district/city governments, or provincial governments to the National Council. Proposals must meet specific criteria, such as including a development location map and area size separate from residential zones, a proposed SEZ spatial plan with zoning regulations, financing plans and sources, environmental approvals, economic and financial feasibility studies, a defined duration for the SEZ, strategic plans, and at least 50% land control of the proposed area. Once an SEZ is designated, the proposing business entity is appointed as the developer and manager of the SEZ. Alternatively, if proposed by the Central or Regional Government, they appoint a business entity to manage and develop the SEZ. Operational management in SEZ includes the establishment of central and regional institutions. At the central level, the National Council oversees SEZ implementation and may form a Secretariat to support its work. Similarly, Regional Councils may establish their Secretariats. Each SEZ has an Administrator appointed by the Central Government to manage services, supervision, and operational controls.\n",
      "(1628) Changes were also made to the incentives provided to SEZs. Businesses operating within SEZs receive Income Tax (PPh) benefits but are no longer eligible for reductions in Land and Building Taxes. For imports into SEZs, businesses may benefit from exemptions and deferrals of import duties, excise duty exemptions for raw materials or production aids, VAT and Luxury Goods Tax exemptions, and relief from import income taxes. Furthermore, businesses are granted regional tax and retribution reductions, including reductions in Land and Building Acquisition Duties and Land and Building Taxes. For SEZs focused on non-production and non-processing activities, imported consumer goods that are not excise taxable are granted exemptions from import duties and are not subject to import taxes, in accordance with their specific business activities. Consumer goods that are subject to excise duties receive excise tax exemptions and similar import duty reliefs. SEZs are granted streamlined processes, acceleration, and special procedures for acquiring land rights, extensions, and renewals. Additional benefits include eased business licensing, streamlined industrial and commercial operations, port-related activities, and immigration facilities for foreign nationals, as well as enhanced security provisions.\n",
      "(1636) Table 1. Comparison of SEZ Policy in Indonesia\n",
      "(1636) \n",
      "(1639) Gresik SEZ Policy\n",
      "(1708) KEK Gresik (Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus Gresik) is one of Indonesia's Special Economic Zones (SEZs), located in Gresik, East Java. As stated in Peraturan Pemerintah (PP) Nomor 71 Tahun 2021 about Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus Gresik (Gresik SEZ), it is a designated area aimed at fostering economic development through incentives, infrastructure, and job opportunities, particularly in industrial and manufacturing sectors. Gresik SEZ covers 2,167 hectares located in Manyar District, Gresik Regency.\n",
      "(1837) According to PP No. 71 Tahun 2021, Gresik SEZ is intended to be a place for manufacturing, logistics and distribution, research, and development. Their industry focused on high-tech products (HTP) industries, metal industries, pioneering and export-based electrical industries, chemical industries, and energy and logistics sectors. This policy emphasizes Gresik’s position as an industry powerhouse in East Java Province. Before, Gresik was already known for its industrial output. Due to its natural resource base and proximity to Tanjung Perak Port, one of Indonesia's busiest ports, Gresik has potential and excellent access to international and domestic markets. Some of the reasons make Gresik to be the home of many manufacturing industries, such as PT. Semen Gresik, one of the largest cement producers in the country, and several chemical and petrochemical plants.\n",
      "(1837) \n",
      "(1842) Figure 2. Gresik SEZ Area\n",
      "(1897) Furthermore, PP No. 71 of 2021 provides a policy framework to establish Gresik as a key SEZ in Indonesia. While it emphasizes the area to accelerate job creation and economic development in Gresik, it proposes strategic objectives by utilizing Gresik’s strategic location, integrated infrastructure, and high-value industries. The strategic objectives/targets mentioned in the regulation are:\n",
      "(1910) Strengthen regional competitiveness and increase Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) in East Java.\n",
      "(1925) Attract local and foreign direct investment in industries such as high-tech manufacturing, chemicals, and logistics.\n",
      "(1938) Create employment opportunities to drive economic growth through industrial development and support businesses\n",
      "(1951) Boost Indonesia’s export capacity and reduce reliance on imported goods by producing substitute\n",
      "(2030) To incorporate its strengths and achieve goals, Gresik SEZ grants special regulations, and incentives designed to attract investment and stimulate economic growth. Those incentives are differentiated by fiscal and non-fiscal. These incentives are designed to make Gresik SEZ an attractive destination for both domestic and international investors. The idea is to reduce costs and administrative burdens, hence will make Gresik SEZ a profitable investment for doing business. Below are the incentives based on Peraturan Pemerintah No. 40 of 2021:\n",
      "(2038) Table 2. Fiscal Policy Implementation in Gresik SEZ\n",
      "(2038) \n",
      "(2046) Table 3. Non-Fiscal Policy Implementation in Gresik SEZ\n",
      "(2046) \n",
      "(2048) Policy Implementation\n",
      "(2051) Gresik Spatial Plan\n",
      "(2232) According to Gresik’s Spatial Plan (RTRW) 2010-2030, its long-term vision is to accommodate an investment-friendly culture and sustainable environment. Its first mission to achieve that vision is accommodating the development of industry, trade, agriculture, fisheries, marine resources, and tourism. Furthermore, in its policies and strategies, it is mentioned that Gresik is preparing and encouraging the development of the National Activity Center (Pusat Kegiatan Nasional/ PKN) within its boundary as a center for government, public service facilities, industry, trade, and services, as well as urban settlements. Specifically on its policy of industrial zones, Gresik aims to develop environmentally friendly industrial areas along with 21 strategies to achieve it. Among those strategies, it is already stated to allocate land for small and medium-sized industries and develop medium-sized and large industrial areas in strategically designated locations with a minimum area of 50 hectares. There are also strategies to attract investments from foreign and domestic capital sources, establish partnerships with investors for the development of industrial and warehousing areas, and provide incentive instruments such as tax and levy relief, tax reduction, or exemptions, among others.\n",
      "(2232) \n",
      "(2238) Figure 3. Gresik Regency's Strategic Areas\n",
      "(2433) As can be seen from Figure 3, Manyar Industrial Zone (grey) has been determined to be one of Gresik Regency’s Strategic Areas (Kawasan Strategis Kabupaten) in the regulation that was established in 2011. This aligns with the current development of Java Integrated Industrial and Port Estate (JIIPE) which has been appointed as a Special Economic Zone by Presidential Decree. Moreover, the total industrial zone in the overall spatial pattern covers approximately 12,448.026 hectares, including zones for large-scale, medium-scale, and household industries, emphasizing policies that are indeed directed towards industry. Large and medium industries are planned to be concentrated along primary arterial and collector roads connecting Gresik, Lamongan, and Surabaya. Meanwhile, household industries such as fish canning, food production, batik, furniture, handicrafts, and others are spread across all districts of Gresik Regency. To ensure the sustainability and accessibility of this industrial zone, key directions include green buffer and corridor establishment, ecological considerations in industrial development, frontage load provision along arterial and collector roads, integration across production processes, and disaster risk management. Programs for this industrial development are mainly for supporting infrastructures including road development, clean water provision, sanitation, worker housing, industrial port development, and institutional development.\n",
      "(2532) The construction of the JIIPE industrial zone itself started in early 2013 and started to operationalize in 2016. On 9 March 2018 it was officially inaugurated and finally on 28 June 2021 it was officially designated as Special Economic Zone. The development of this SEZ aligns with the Regional Spatial Plan, specifically the spatial pattern of industrial and port zones, thus the land use changes that occurred are still following the plan. However, the spatial plan did not mention the reclamation process for the industrial port in its articles and other maps, only depicted in the spatial pattern map. \n",
      "(2692) In the detailed masterplan of JIIPE SEZ, there are 3 main zones including industrial estate, port estate, and real estate. The industrial estate (1761 Ha) will have 5 main clusters: metal, chemical, energy, electronic, and logistic cluster. The port estate (406 Ha) will have a -16 meters depth, which can accommodate large container ships and bulk carriers up to 100,000 DWT. This will complement Tanjung Perak in Surabaya to ease its traffic, due to JIIPE’s deeper draft and ability to handle bigger vessels for industrial purposes. The residential area (800 Ha) will consist of not only housing, hotels, and CBD, but also a golf course, entertainment, and university. This master plan aligns with agglomeration theory, as specialized clusters enable economies of scale, enhance efficiency, and reduce production costs. Furthermore, direct port, rail, and toll access can minimize logistics costs and improve access to markets, suppliers, and customers. Additionally, housing provisions within SEZ can accommodate labor pooling and promote knowledge spillovers.\n",
      "(2692) \n",
      "(2694) Economic Issues\n",
      "(2785) In 2023, The Gresik SEZ achieved a remarkable target of investment, which is the highest among other SEZs in Indonesia (Figure 4). The investment in 2023 added approximately IDR 33.4 trillion, mainly coming from the investment of PT. Freeport with the smelter development in the Gresik SEZ area and other foreign investors. Moreover, Gresik SEZ dominates the SEZ economy with a good track of investment and labor absorption. With the current Smelter operationalization, Gresik SEZ is expected to influence the economic growth in Gresik, East Java, and at the National level.\n",
      "(2785) \n",
      "(2792) Figure 4. SEZ Investment Realization Report, 2023\n",

      "(2806) Figure 5. Gresik and East Java Economic Growth Rate (%)\n",
      "(2809) Sources: BPS Gresik\n",
      "(2899) Figure 5 demonstrates the economic growth rates of Gresik and East Java (Jawa Timur) from 2011 to 2023. Overall, Gresik's growth rates exhibit greater fluctuation compared to East Java, with a notable peak in 2015 at 11.58%. This peak indicated the beginning of JIIPE development in Gresik in 2015. The economic growth was gradually stable until 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp contraction to -4.38%. However, the economy rebounded in 2021, showing resilience and recovery. Meanwhile, East Java's growth rates remained lower than Gresik's, indicating Gresik's economic dynamism.\n",
      "(3025) As part of Indonesia's strategy to create competitive economic hubs, the Gresik SEZ focuses on attracting investments in export-oriented and import-substituting industries. Integrating manufacturing with port logistics enhances economic efficiency and growth potential. Figure 6 shows the East Java Investment Realization from 2010 to 2023, illustrating the growth of both foreign direct investment and domestic investment. Before Gresik SEZ's inauguration, domestic investment dominates the total investment in East Java. The foreign direct investment grew significantly in 2021, which marked the beginning of Gresik SEZ. As of 2023, the Gresik SEZ had attracted IDR more than 70 trillion in East Java foreign direct investment and created approximately 24,000 jobs during its construction phase, significantly contributing to the post-pandemic economic recovery (Dewan Nasional KEK, 2023; Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, 2023).\n",
      "(3025) \n",

      "(3032) \n",
      "(3037) Figure 7. Gresik Economic Structure\n",
      "(3040) Sources: BPS Gresik\n",
      "(3175) Gresik's economic growth is largely driven by its manufacturing sector, which contributes nearly 50% of the region's GDP (Figure 7). Industries such as chemicals, food, and metal processing are key contributors. In Gresik, the manufacturing sector overwhelmingly dominates the economic structure, occupying a significantly larger share compared to other sectors. In addition, other notable sectors in Gresik include wholesale and retail trade, construction, and mining and quarrying. Wholesale and retail trade contribute substantially, showcasing the region's reliance on trade activities facilitated by its industrial growth. Construction also plays a significant role, likely driven by ongoing infrastructure and industrial development within the SEZ. Mining and quarrying, though smaller in scale, underline the region's resource-based activities mainly in sand mining. Consequently, the SEZ policy contributes to economic growth in Gresik and East Java at the regional level.\n",
      "(3175) \n",
      "(3177) Labor Issues\n",
      "(3279) The Gresik SEZ policy implementation in labor aspects has been implemented in Government Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah) No. 40 of 2021 and Regional Regulations as its derivatives. The labor-related policy mostly regulates foreign workers' access and permits in Indonesia’s SEZ. It makes it accessible and convenient for foreign investors to develop the technology and knowledge in Gresik SEZ, supporting the knowledge transfer for local workers. However, the policy associated with local workers only accommodates in Regional Regulation (Peraturan Daerah) No. 7 of 2022. This separation in policy implementation affects the coherence between both policies to have fair benefits for local and foreign workers. \n",
      "(3469) In 2023, the Gresik SEZ establishment and development impacted 11,573 new employees, with a total realization labor absorption of around 32,000 people (SEZ, 2023). According to the Ministry of Manpower Indonesia (2023), Gresik SEZ had absorbed 24,000 workers until the third quarter of the year 2023; the biggest contributors are the construction sector, with labor absorption of 11,000 workers. Figure 8 shows Gresik’s employment structure in 2023, focusing on five sectors that are associated with the goals and the Gresik SEZ growth. Around 44.9% of labor in Gresik works in the service sector and 14.6% works in the agricultural. Manufacturing industries have 27.5% of the total labor force in Gresik, which is the highest contributor to Gresik's economy. Around 9 out of 100 people in Gresik work as Construction workers, and only 3.7% work in Transportation and Storage. Since the development of JIIPE and SEZ, the labor structure in Gresik shows the development of labor, particularly in manufacturing, construction, transportation, and storage. This phenomenon is due to the expansion of employment opportunities in the related sectors, aligning with the port development, industrial cluster, and real estate development in Gresik SEZ.\n",
      "(3469) \n",
      "(3478) Figure 8. Employment in Gresik by Main industries, 2023\n",
      "(3487) Sources: Labor Force Survey, BPS (data processed by author)\n",
      "(3601) The development of Gresik SEZ also influences the growth of informal workers in Gresik Regency. Informal worker growth in East Java and Gresik has a similar trend, although there is a slightly increasing trend during the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 9). At the beginning of the construction of JIIPE Gresik in 2016, 47.5% of the employees in Gresik worked in the informal sector. The trend is gradually decreasing each year. In the last 3 years of Gresik SEZ's inauguration, there has been a decline in the number of informal workers. It indirectly explains that the development of Gresik SEZ has a positive impact on economic growth as well as the decreasing trend of informal workers.\n",
      "(3601) \n",
      "(3608) Figure 9. Gresik's Informal Workers Trend 2016-2023\n",

      "(3624) Figure 10. Average Wage of Informal Workers by Educational Level\n",
      "(3630) Sources: Labor Force Survey, BPS Gresik\n",
      "(3748) The informal worker phenomenon should become a policymaking concern as part of the development of SEZ in Gresik. The agglomeration industry has a local impact, which is associated with not only economic growth and knowledge spillover but also the local community. Gresik SEZ will eventually develop urbanization economies and externalities (Nielsen et al., 2021). Gresik SEZ agglomeration amplifies competition for clients and local resources, including specialized labor and physical space, resulting in both advantages and congestion-related challenges. These challenges are explained by Nielsen et al. (2021), who argue that the spillover effect of foreign industries could occur in different industries as well. Therefore, understanding the informal phenomenon is crucial to obtaining the benefit of SEZ agglomeration in Gresik.\n",
      "(3841) Furthermore, Figure 10 demonstrates the average wage of informal workers in Gresik from 2021-2023. The graphs show that the average wage in the informal sector is less than IDR 3 million per month. This pattern indicates the vulnerability of informal workers in the Gresik Regency. The average wage increases as the educational level is higher, but it is still far below the bare minimum regional wage level. Consequently, the existence of informal workers could improve and be part of diversification in economics, but they need decent work to escape unemployment and vulnerable conditions.\n",
      "(3967) The Gresik benefit from investment and regional growth from JIIPE and SEZ development. In the labor structure, manufacturing, construction, and transportation are the main industries directly affected by infrastructure development and the operation of the Gresik industrial cluster. Most workers in Gresik have jobs with skills such as processing workers, machine operators, and manual workers (Figure 11). Meanwhile, there are fewer high-skill workers than low-skill workers. In manufacturing industries, the highest share of processing workers is dominating. However, manual workers are concentrated in the construction, transportation, and storage industries. This trend shows that Gresik's working population is concentrated in low-skill jobs. Therefore, the labor issues in policy implementation of Gresik SEZ should consider the skill match to the high technology industry development, particularly in Gresik SEZ.\n",
      "(3967) \n",
      "(3978) Figure 11. Employment in Gresik by Skill Level (KBJI 2014), 2023\n",
      "(3987) Sources: Labor Force Survey, BPS (data processed by author)\n",
      "(4167) The low-skill workers can be seen through the labor educational attainment level in Gresik, as shown in Figure 12. Data from the Labor Force Survey (BPS, 2023) illustrates that almost half of the working population in Gresik only have a minimum formal education level in secondary school or lower. Workers who graduated from high school and vocational school totaled 26.9% and 17.2%, respectively. Only 12.2% of workers have a bachelor’s degree. This domination of workers with low education levels is not meeting the demands of workers in Gresik SEZ. The recent job hiring in Gresik SEZ looks for workers in financial and planning production with a minimum education level of a bachelor’s degree and who could communicate in English. Since most of the foreign workers are coming from China, additional language is preferable when hiring people to work in the Gresik SEZ area. The skill mismatch and gap of local workers hinder the valuable job opportunities that continue to increase each year, resulting in local workers being left behind to become unemployed or taking over manual workers and low-paying jobs.\n",

      "(4285) Figure 13 describes the composition of unemployed people in Gresik. In 2023, the biggest share of unemployment came from vocational school graduates. Higher education shows the smallest share of unemployment, while the secondary level has the highest share of unemployment. In addition, unemployment by educational level shows an increasing trend for higher education and vocational schools (Figure 14). Although higher education shows declining in unemployment shares, the trend also illustrates that few people graduate from vocational school and higher education (bachelor's or master's) but cannot enter employment. The skill mismatch-related policy and training should be implemented to reduce this issue.\n",

      "(4440) Moreover, compared to the foreign worker policy in SEZ, the Ministry of Manpower has the authority to issue working permits or Rencana Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing (RPTKA) for Foreign Workers who carry out economic activities in Indonesia, especially in the SEZ area. The realization of the permit issued shows the highest request in 2022, probably due to the pandemic travel limitation for foreigners. From 2023 to 2024, the Ministry of Manpower has already issued more than 3600 working permits in East Java (Figure 15). Most foreign workers were coming from China (49.2%), Japan (9.5%), and South Korea (9.3%) (Figure 16). Meanwhile, the number of foreign workers from the United States gradually increased after the investment of PT. Freeport Smelter Industries in the Gresik SEZ area.\n",

      "(4630) Working permits for foreigners require specific experiences and educational backgrounds that should be aligned with the industry. The foreign worker's policy limits the high position level for foreign workers, but foreign workers benefitted in other aspects of immigration and residence permits while working in Indonesia. The job positions of foreign workers are characterized by professional workers, consultants, advisors, and managers with high education and much experience in the industries. According to the RPTKA Reports, around 53% of foreign workers who have work permits in Indonesia has professional job positions, and 49% of foreigners work in the industrial sector. This report shows that the gap is profound between foreign and local workers in the specialized skill jobs industry. In addition, approximately 3% of foreign workers are located in East Java Provinces. This condition will eventually be associated with the development of Gresik SEZ, which has the highest contribution to foreign investment compared to other SEZ areas in Indonesia. \n",
      "(4793) In conclusion, the implementation of labor policy in Gresik has covered both foreign and local workers and has compromised both existing issues. According to the Ministry of Manpower Indonesia (2023), the projected high scenario labor demand is 46,096 workers in 2028, which still cannot reach the targeted 199,818 workers in 2030. Discussing specifically local labor, the absorption of Gresik’s local labor only reached 45%, which is still below the minimum target of 60% based on Gresik Regional Regulation No. 7 of 2022. A skill mismatch between local labor and foreign workers causes this condition. The local workers have the limited skills to fill high-position jobs and are left with low-skill jobs and even informal jobs, while foreign workers fill the gap and obtain the benefit of Gresik SEZ growth through higher wages than local workers. This issue is important for evaluating labor policies in Gresik and at the national level to provide an advantage of SEZ development for local communities and regional development.\n",
      "(4797) Policy Analysis and Evaluation\n",
      "(4802) Emerging Issues on The Environment \n",
      "(4881) Gresik's Environmental Quality Index (Indeks Kualitas Lingkungan Hidup/ IKLH) is still categorized as medium quality, although it falls below the East Java average (Figure 17) and its target. This indicator is a national measurement of environmental quality, indicating a region’s environmental condition based on its water, land, and air quality. Despite many industries in Gresik, including the JIIPE industrial zone, the air quality index and the other 7 parameters of the Air Pollution Standard Index still indicate good conditions. \n",
      "(4881) \n",
      "(4890) Figure 17. Environmental Quality Index in East Java, 2022-2023\n",
      "(4957) In the JIIPE SEZ itself, they aim to be a waste-free Industrial Zone. They use modern sewage treatment systems to ensure the sustainability of the environment. The Waste-Water Treatment Plant has a capacity of 5000 m3/day that can treat all factory waste located inside SEZ. By doing this, pollution and environmental degradation as common concerns of the industrial zones are already mitigated by JIIPE as Gresik SEZ.\n",
      "(4960) Economic and Investment\n",
      "(5154) Gresik SEZ development has positively affected the economic growth and investment in Gresik and East Java. Policy in giving accessibility and convenience in tax effectively attracts more foreign direct investment to the SEZ areas. Table 4 shows the result of the Location Quotient (LQ) analysis, which defines the two types of local industries in Gresik: basic industries and non-basic industries. LQ is a method to measure the export base of a region and estimate the number of output directly linked to export demands for goods and services. LQ values more than 1, which means that the industry is an export industry, covering more supply for exporting to other regions. However, LQ values less than 1 mean that the industry could not meet the demand in local consumption, explaining the import industries. The LQ analysis using Gresik’s GRDP shows the manufacturing, mining, and electricity sectors have been Gresik's basic industries since 2015 This means Gresik's vision in developing an industrial cluster has been successfully achieved. Construction also becomes a basic industry from 2016 to 2020. It aligns with the development of JIIPE and Gresik SEZ which was influenced by the ongoing construction of industrial clusters.\n",

      "(5347) Ministry of Manpower and INDEF estimated the impact of Gresik SEZ investment on economic output using CGE Analysis (Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, 2023). The report found that the investment in Gresik SEZ significantly impacted the economic output of different industries (Figure 18). The biggest effect is in water supply and waste management, which is predicted to grow by 6.37%, followed by manufacturing as the main industry (6.15%). Water supply and waste management have become the most significant outputs due to the development of necessary infrastructure in the Gresik SEZ area, including power generators for industrial needs. Moreover, increased economic output as an impact of investment in Gresik SEZ also occurs in ICT industries (4.91%) and Real estate (5.92%). Both industries grow to support the development of the industrial cluster in Gresik SEZ by providing technology systems and residential areas for workers. Therefore, the overall evaluation of economic aspects positively affects the economy of Gresik and East Java. Gresik, with the advanced development of Deep-Sea Port and the proximity to the industrial cluster, will benefit and support regional economic development.\n",

      "(5577) In the context of copper production, PT Freeport Indonesia's smelter in KEK Gresik exemplifies the implementation of “hilirisasi” (Rahmahwati et al., 2022). The new smelter and refinery with an input capacity of 3.3 million tons of concentrate expected to be completed in 2023, transforms raw materials into copper cathodes. It is a particularly high-value product from copper used in various industries. Furthermore, the new smelter indicates ongoing developments in smelting capacity (Rahmahwati et al., 2022). This aligns with the downstream objective of reducing raw exports and exporting finished products instead (Ika, 2017; Rahmahwati et al., 2022). Such projects enhance Indonesia's economic potential by retaining more value within the country and supporting related industries such as electronics and construction. More importantly, a study from Rahmahwati (2022) highlights that if Indonesia continues to export copper concentrates without developing domestic smelting and refining capacities, it could result in a significant loss of added value. Estimated at USD 6,861,520,000 by 2030. Additionally, failing to develop smelters, refineries, and intermediary industries could lead to an even greater loss of USD 8,707,930,000 (Rahmahwati et al., 2022). Therefore, the step that Gresik SEZ has taken is a wise decision to strengthen the downstream process in strategic investments to optimize the industry's value chain in Indonesia\n",
      "(5664) However, implementing minerals downstream is not without challenges. As highlighted by Ika (2017), the government faces significant hurdles, including the need to strengthen production bases in upstream sectors, ensure legal certainty, and promote integration between upstream and downstream industries. The ongoing demands from companies like PT Freeport Indonesia also necessitate policy adjustments to facilitate seamless operations. Moreover, revising Law No. 4/2009 on mineral and coal mining has been proposed as a more effective solution than enacting multiple regulations that often fail to address core issues (Ika, 2017).\n",
      "(5664) \n",
      "(5779) To complement this, The Indonesian government has demonstrated substantial support for the Gresik SEZ, particularly the JIIPE, through various initiatives aimed at enhancing its appeal to investors and fostering economic growth that has been discussed previously. The government's acknowledgment of JIIPE's excellence is evident through awards such as the Best Industrial Special Economic Zone. The recognition not only highlights the government's support but also serves to boost the SEZ's profile among potential foreign and domestic investors. Moreover, the government also has been instrumental in facilitating major projects like the development of PT Freeport Indonesia's copper smelter. The government's involvement includes providing tax breaks and ensuring the availability of reliable electricity to support the smelter's operations.\n",
      "(5782) Labor Absorption Evaluation\n",
      "(5907) Labor absorption and the skill gap are critical concerns in evaluating the Gresik SEZ policy, particularly due to the pronounced skill mismatch within the industrial sector. To address these challenges, an analysis using the Location Quotient (LQ) and Job Multiplier Base has been conducted to assess the multiplier effects of Gresik SEZ development at the regional level. These tools provide insights into the sectoral contributions and job creation dynamics stimulated by the SEZ. Furthermore, the implementation of Peraturan Daerah Gresik No. 7 of 2022 underscores the urgency of achieving targeted local workforce absorption within Gresik's industrial zones, aiming to enhance the integration of local labor into the industrial ecosystem while reducing dependency on external workers in high positions and fostering knowledge spillover to local workers.  \n",
      "(6000) Table 5 shows the result of LQ, shift share, and multiplier base analysis. The LQ analysis demonstrates that in 2021 and 2023, manufacturing, electricity and gas, transportation and storage, real estate activities, and business activities are basic industries, indicating enough supply of total employment in Gresik. Focusing on the Gresik SEZ development, construction becomes a basic industry in 2023, aligning with the SEZ report that the highest contributors of labor absorption in 2023, with more than 11,000 workers in the building process of Smelter PT. Freeport and Xinyi Glass Group in Gresik SEZ.\n",
      "(6121) Gresik shift-share analysis could evaluate how the development of the SEZ has influenced economic growth compared to East Java regions. It demonstrates the economic changes from regional trends, industry-specific dynamics, and Gresik’s competitive effects. Shift share results in the high growth of labor-competitive industries, which are manufacturing, water supply and waste management, construction, wholesale trade, Transportation and storage, ICT, accommodation and food services, real estate, and business activities. It shows that the effect of Gresik SEZ development will have a multiplier effect on other sectors, particularly in services and the construction of other supporting facilities such as healthcare and housing. Similarly, a growing trend also occurs in the ICT sector, which shows that the industries dominating Gresik SEZ are high-technology industries.\n",
      "(6209) Moreover, the multiplier effect is estimated through job multiplier base analysis, focusing on the Gresik economics development, and increased labor opportunities in each sector could contribute to the opportunities in other sectors. The most widely used method for estimating the multipliers effect is Input/Output (I/O) Analysis (Lopes et al., 2023). However, the regional data in Gresik SEZ is currently insufficient to calculate the I/O table. Therefore, this analysis uses a simple calculation of the ratio of total and basic industries employment. The results are explained in Table 5.\n",
      "(6368) In the Gresik SEZ case, the analysis will focus on the manufacturing industries. The manufacturing industries have an impact on regional job creation. The multiplier base for manufacturing is stable between 2021 and 2023, with a value of 3.48 and 3.63, respectively. This value means that every job created by the manufacturing industry will add 2 or 3 jobs to other industries. It shows that considering more investment in Gresik SEZ will eventually add more job creation in Gresik and East Java. For example, investment and the development of Smelter PT. Freeport in Gresik SEZ affects other jobs, such as transportation storage and real estate, or more job opportunities are developed in Gresik. Consequently, Gresik SEZ industrial investment and job opportunities benefit the regional economy through the multiplier effect scheme. However, this analysis is very simple due to insufficient data, but it could give a brief explanation of whether SEZ areas have a positive impact on regional job creation.\n",

      "(6537) Additionally, an advanced analysis using Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) INDOTERM (Indonesia the Enormous Regional Model) has been conducted by the Ministry of Manpower, collaborating with INDEF researchers in estimating the impact on investment to labor absorption in Gresik SEZ. The report reveals that the investment in Gresik SEZ positively impacts employment opportunities in other industries. Figure 19 shows the different impacts for each industry (Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, 2023). The biggest impact on job opportunities is financial and insurance services, which are predicted to grow by 7.82%, followed by business services (7.61%) and health services (7.52%). Growing employment opportunities in this sector could be an effect of the development of complete infrastructure in Gresik SEZ. Currently, the development of Gresik SEZ also prioritizes the housing area and hospital (SEZ Reports, 2023). In addition, increased job opportunities also happen in wholesale and retail (6.09%), manufacturing (4.22%), and Transportation and storage (3.63%).\n",

      "(6727) In 2023, the Ministry of Manpower and INDEF collaborated to produce labor projections for 2024-2028 in Gresik SEZ (Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, 2023). The projection model produces a moderate and low scenario based on investment data compiled by Dewan Kawasan Ekonomi Khusus (KEK). The results show that the trend for investments in Gresik SEZ will increase from IDR 59 trillion in 2024 to IDR 130 trillion in 2028 with the low scenario. For a moderate scenario, the investment will increase to IDR178 trillion in 2028. This model is used to estimate the labor projection in Gresik SEZ (Figure 20). The model estimates labor absorption in Gresik SEZ will gradually increase from 20,953 workers in 2024 to 46,06 workers in 2028 (low scenario). Meanwhile, Gresik SEZ, with a moderate scenario, is predicted to absorb 27,239 employees in 2024 to 62,859 workers in 2028. The labor projection illustrates the increasing trend of labor opportunities for local workers, enhancing the competitive advantage of agglomeration industrial locations in the Gresik and East Java regions.\n",
      "(6851) However, the situation in Gresik SEZ is currently in the spotlight due to the unachievable target of local workers' absorption. This problem occurs because the supply of workers does not meet the demands of Peraturan Daerah No. 7 of 2022, which states that in industries in Gresik, at least 60% of workers come from local workers. In 2023, the labor absorption for local workers in Gresik only covers 45% of total employment (Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, 2023). This phenomenon creates conflict among the local community in the surrounding areas of Gresik SEZ in the Manyar district. This achievement should be evaluated further, with skill mismatch problems becoming one of the reasons why the demand does not yet meet the target and significantly affects the local workers.\n",
      "(6851) \n",

      "(6870) Sources: Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan (2023)\n",
      "(7000) The policies in Peraturan Daerah need to evaluate whether the target of 60% local workers is benefitting both regional and manufacturing. By focusing on the skill mismatch problem, the target is unrealistic considering the current human resources development and educational background of employment in Gresik. From the analysis and current implementation, the majority of Gresik workers are at a low educational level, work in the informal sector, and contribute more to low-skill jobs, such as machine operators and manual workers. Conversely, foreign workers supply high-skill jobs and take advantage of the job opportunities. With incoherent demands from national and local regulations about labor policy, the current demands from the Gresik government might not be achieved further. As a result, Gresik’s labor force will lose labor opportunities in Gresik SEZ development. \n",
      "(7098) Besides, the increasing trend of new entry permits for foreign workers each year could profoundly challenge local workers to compete with high-skill labor migrants. This condition was also exacerbated by insufficient curriculum in vocational schools and limited training capacity in Gresik Regency. Table 6 describes the background requirement as the demand for job opportunities in Gresik SEZ. Some of the courses have been taught at vocational and bachelor’s degree levels. Therefore, the Gresik government needs to match and work in partnership with Gresik SEZ management to enhance skill matching between supply and demand labor in the Gresik regions.\n",

      "(7252) The Gresik SEZ faces critical challenges in labor absorption and addressing skill gaps, particularly in aligning local workforce capabilities with industrial demands. The Gresik SEZ's significant economic contributions include a multiplier effect on regional job creation, focusing on high-technology and construction industries. However, local worker absorption remains below the mandated 60% of Gresik Government Regulation in labor policy, attributed to skill mismatches, insufficient vocational training, and limited capacity for upskilling programs. Additionally, foreign workers often fill high-skill positions, further limiting opportunities for the local workforce. Peraturan Daerah No. 7 of 2022 requires urgent evaluation to realistically balance local labor targets with the region's current educational and skill development levels. Collaborative efforts between the government, vocational institutions, and SEZ management are necessary to enhance workforce skill matching and gain the SEZ's full potential for regional economic growth.\n",
      "(7252) \n",
      "(7259) Benchmarking and SWOT Analysis Gresik SEZ Policy\n",
      "(7384) Benchmarking, and Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis are essential tools in evaluating the Gresik SEZ’s performance and guiding its development strategy. Benchmarking compares the Gresik SEZ with successful SEZs globally, such as those in China, India, and Poland, to identify several aspects including the SEZ establishment and development, its impact and contribution to the economic sector, and its environmental and operational management. Meanwhile, SWOT analysis provides a structured framework to assess the SEZ’s internal strengths, such as government support and strategic location, alongside weaknesses like skill mismatches, and external opportunities, such as infrastructure expansion, and threats like environmental concerns. This dual approach fosters strategic planning, risk mitigation, and effective decision-making while engaging stakeholders through a clear understanding of the SEZ’s potential and challenges.\n",
      "(7604) The establishment of the Gresik Special Economic Zone (SEZ) was evidence to Indonesia's commitment to fostering national economic growth and regional development through a robust legal framework. Gresik SEZ complies with Law Number 39 of 2009 on Special Economic Zones, which provides the foundational guidelines for the designation, development, and management of SEZs. Later, this policy was revised by Law Number 11 of 2020 on Job Creation, and its subsequent as a formal law through Law Number 6 of 2023. Gresik SEZ development was based on Government Regulation Number 40 of 2021 on the Implementation of Gresik Special Economic Zones, which specifically details the mechanisms for implementing SEZ policies, including incentives, land use, and infrastructure development. Moreover, it aligns with Article 31 of Law No. 25 of 2007 on Investment, prioritizing investments that contribute to equitable regional development, infrastructure improvements, and increased employment opportunities. In regional scope, Gresik SEZ also aligned with Gresik Spatial Plan (RTRW) 2010-2030 regulation (Government Regulation of Gresik Regency Number 8 of 2011) and Detailed Spatial Plan of Planning Area Part of Manyar Bungah Year 2020-2040 (Regulation of Gresik Regent Number 16 of 2021). Both regional regulations emphasize spatial integration that reflects careful consideration of land use, environmental sustainability, and urban planning principles, further reinforcing the strategic importance of the SEZ in supporting Gresik’s economic growth.\n",
      "(7749) The development of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in various countries has been guided by specific legal and regulatory frameworks to align with their economic objectives (Pakdeenurit et al., 2014). For instance, the United States pioneered SEZs with the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of 1934, aiming to boost international trade by reducing customs and regulatory barriers, particularly near ports and airports. China, a leading example, introduced SEZs like Shenzhen in 1980, under clear legal provisions that transferred economic authority from the central to local governments, emphasizing investment incentives, tax exemptions, and simplified bureaucratic processes. India, with its SEZ Act of 2005, focused on fostering exports and foreign direct investment by establishing large industrial zones supported by streamlined approvals, tax incentives, and world-class infrastructure. Across these examples, successful SEZs have demonstrated adherence to robust regulatory frameworks, which prioritize operational efficiency, investor confidence, and alignment with national economic strategies.\n",
      "(7892) The Gresik SEZ has significantly impacted the economic sector by boosting investments, fostering industrial development, and contributing to regional economic growth. Gresik SEZ attracted major industries, including high-tech manufacturing, chemical production, and logistics, supported by its strategic location near Tanjung Perak Port. Key industries such as manufacturing, construction, and transportation have seen significant job growth, with manufacturing serving as the backbone of the SEZ's economic output. Moreover, the SEZ has created substantial employment opportunities, generating a multiplier effect that has benefited related sectors, such as retail, housing, and services. The development of supporting infrastructure and integration into Gresik's Spatial Plan has enhanced regional competitiveness, increased Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), and created a multiplier effect on other sectors, such as housing, retail, and services. The Gresik SEZ continues to enhance regional competitiveness by reducing reliance on imports, promoting exports, and fostering industrial diversification.\n",
      "(8032) However, the impacts of SEZs on the surrounding economic development in other countries varied widely. The impact of China's SEZs on neighboring regions has been minimal in terms of economic spillovers (Yan et al., 2015). While SEZ areas have demonstrated strong marine industrial competitiveness, their benefits largely remained confined within their own boundaries. Similar to China, SEZs in Laos significantly impacted economic performance but were primarily localized in their host districts only (Phommachanh, 2024). The spillover effects to adjacent districts are not as pronounced, potentially due to weak linkages between the SEZs and the broader regional economy. In Russia, the impact of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) on the domestic market has been largely positive (Dubinina, 2023). SEZs have significantly boosted firm revenues and total factor productivity (TFP), which contributed to regional economic development, particularly in the industrial and logistic sectors.\n",
      "(8157) The Gresik Special Economic Zone (SEZ) has made significant strides in increasing labor absorption, creating approximately 24,000 jobs as of the third quarter of 2023 (Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, 2023). However, it faces challenges in meeting its local labor absorption target. Currently, only 45% of the workers are sourced locally, falling short of the 60% target set by local regulations, specifically the Government Regulation of Gresik Regency Number 1 of 2022. The gap is attributed to various factors, including skill mismatches, a high regional minimum wage (Upah Minimum Regional, UMR) attracting non-local workers, and insufficient alignment between local educational programs and industrial needs. Addressing these issues requires enhanced collaboration between industries and educational institutions, curriculum adjustments to meet SEZ demands, and the expansion of vocational training programs.\n",
      "(8353) Every SEZ in other countries increases employment gradually, though their impact on the local labor absorption was various. China's Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have significantly increased employment opportunities, especially through the creation of new firms and the expansion of existing large firms. Even though the SEZs have attracted new investments and enhanced industrial development, much of the labor demand is filled by non-local workers, partly due to skill mismatches and disparities in local labor market readiness (Zheng, 2021). A similar situation also happened in Pakistan, where local labor absorption remains limited. Karim et al. (2024) indicated that SEZs in Pakistan often attract workers from outside the immediate locality, particularly due to skill mismatches and the high demand for specialized labor that is not always available within the local workforce. In contrast, India’s Special Economic Zones (SEZs), established under the SEZ Act of 2005, have had a significant impact on local labor markets by increasing employment in manufacturing and services (Gallé et al., 2024). The significant impact of SEZs on local labor absorption in India is driven by proximity, industry-specific labor demand, skill development, infrastructure improvements, favorable policies, economic diversification, and positive spillover effects on surrounding areas.\n",
      "(8468) The environmental management of the Gresik SEZ emphasizes compliance with environmental impact assessments (EIA) and adherence to sustainable development principles. All industrial and infrastructure developments within the SEZ undergo EIA processes, ensuring that construction and operations mitigate environmental risks. The SEZ incorporates green buffers, ecological corridors, and disaster risk management strategies as part of its spatial planning, as outlined in Gresik’s Spatial Plan (RTRW) 2010–2030 and Regulation of Gresik Regent Number 16 of 2021. Additionally, advanced waste management systems and water conservation measures are employed to minimize pollution and support sustainable resource use. These efforts align industrial expansion with ecological preservation, showcasing the Gresik SEZ as a model for balancing economic growth and environmental responsibility.\n",
      "(8588) Every SEZ around the world implements an environmental management system to maintain environmental sustainability. However, the planning, implementation and maintenance process varies. In Thailand, SEZ in Chiang Rai Province focuses on municipal solid waste management (MSWM) (Kaewkanta et al., 2022). The system includes an Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) center that handles waste collection, separation, recycling, and disposal. Waste reduction initiatives are supported by the \"3Rs\" principle (reduce, reuse, recycle) and zero-waste policies. On the other hand, the environmental management within Russia's Special Economic Zones (SEZs) often lacks comprehensive planning and enforcement, resulting in significant negative impacts on the environment, including air and water pollution, soil contamination, inadequate waste treatment facilities, and overexploitation of natural resources (Turgel et al., 2019).\n",
      "(8712) Gresik SEZ is managed by a Zone Managing Company (ZMC), PT Berkah Kawasan Manyar Sejahtera (BKMS), which is responsible for the zone's operational and developmental aspects. The ZMC facilitates streamlined licensing, provides fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, and manages infrastructure and land use, thereby creating an investor-friendly environment. Similar to Gresik SEZ, ZMCs also manages the SEZs in Poland (Dorożyński et al., 2021). Interestingly, the ZMC plays a critical role in the success of SEZs, influencing their performance through governance, resource allocation, and promotional efforts. Effective ZMCs focus on attracting investments, facilitating infrastructure development, and providing investor support services, which are crucial for the zones' economic performance. In addition, the benchmarking between Gresik SEZ and SEZs in other countries is summarized in Table 7 below:\n",
      "(8721) Table 7. Gresik SEZ and Other Countries SEZ Benchmarking\n",
      "(8721) \n",
      "(8873) Gresik SEZ has several strengths that can be developed to solidify its position and bolster its impact on economic development. Gresik SEZ has received strong government support embodied in the policies and regulations that give Gresik SEZ a powerful authority to manage and develop itself. Gresik SEZ also has benefits due to its strategic location near Tanjung Perak Port, which is one of Indonesia's busiest deep-sea ports. This location enhances its connectivity for both domestic and international markets, making it a critical logistics hub for East Java and surrounding regions. Additionally, the SEZ is designed for high-value industries such as chemical manufacturing, metal processing, and logistics. The supporting facilities like roads, electricity, and waste management systems are also adequate to assist the manufacturing operation. The integration of these strengths allows the Gresik SEZ to attract significant foreign and domestic investments, contributing to its status as a key player in national economic growth.\n",
      "(9003) Despite its potential, the Gresik SEZ needs to pay attention to its weaknesses. It has to face challenges in local labor integration due to skill mismatches and inadequate training institutions. Local labor absorption is only 45%, far below the 60% target mandated by the Regional Government Regulation of Gresik Regency Number 7 of 2022. Weak law enforcement also allows companies to prioritize foreign or non-local labor over residents for skill matters. Additionally, the limited availability of training programs further constrains the ability of the local workforce to meet the high skill demands of industries operating in the SEZ, impacting the livelihoods and participation of the surrounding community. The SEZ construction also affect the land of local inhabitants, which later can potentially trigger conflicts between the SEZ management and local neighbors. \n",
      "(9110) Fortunately, the Gresik SEZ gains several opportunities that can be utilized to support its development. Gresik SEZ opens numerous opportunities, including the potential for spillover economic benefits in the region. Indonesia has a huge market, making it a favorable investment climate. The investment climate is also supported by fiscal incentives and regulatory reforms, which enhances the zone's attractiveness to both domestic and international investors. Planned infrastructure projects, such as ports, railways, and toll roads, will further strengthen Gresik’s connectivity and economic integration. These plans are poised to stimulate additional industrial growth, not only within the SEZ but also in surrounding areas, which can foster regional economic development.\n",
      "(9208) Nevertheless, Gresik SEZ must deal with several threats that need to be addressed. Environmental concerns pose a significant threat to the Gresik SEZ, with potential risks such as pollution, habitat destruction, and water resource depletion stemming from industrial activities. Furthermore, unequal development can create a gap between the wealthy (the immigrants) and the poor (the locals) which does not meet the purpose of SEZ development itself. Additionally, rapid industrialization and increased migration could exacerbate conflicts between local communities, industries, and immigrant workers. To sum up, Figure 21 depicts the recap of the SWOT analysis conducted by this study.\n",

      "(9218) Policy Recommendation\n",
      "(9294) From previous sections, it can be concluded that JIIPE as Gresik SEZ has already adhered to the spatial regulations, has sufficient environmental safeguards, and has promising economic performance. However, there are also weaknesses, such as weak law enforcement and mismatched local labor that need to be addressed. Opportunities like Indonesia’s appeal to investors and planned infrastructure development offer room for growth, but threats like environmental damage and social conflicts require careful attention to ensure sustainable development.\n",
      "(9410) Based on those findings, several policy recommendations are proposed to create balanced and sustainable growth whilst also addressing socio-economic challenges. In the short term, the efforts should focus on improving local labor skills through training and certification, creating better links between industries and education to match workforce needs, and strengthening connections between JIIPE and East Indonesia to boost regional economic growth. Community development programs are also essential to support displaced locals and help them benefit from the SEZ. In the long term, the focus should shift to expanding vocational schools and universities, fostering partnerships with advanced industries, integrating local businesses into supply chains, and ensuring fair and inclusive development. These recommendations are further elaborated as follows.\n",
      "(9410) \n",
      "(9412) Short-term Recommendation\n",
      "(9416) Hub for East Indonesia\n",
      "(9526) While JIIPE's economic performance as the Gresik Special Economic Zone has shown promising outcomes, an extra effort can also be made to foster other industries' development so that economic growth can happen simultaneously throughout Indonesia. Since one of the current investments in JIIPE is Freeport’s smelter whose raw material is supplied from Papua, East Indonesia, this might be the chance to elevate East Indonesia's economy as well. The ongoing connection between the Gresik industrial zone with that in East Indonesia should be fostered to accommodate the spillover effect to local industries in Papua, ensuring that they are not just being the watchers but also participating and benefitting in this economy.  \n",
      "(9628) One example of the effort that can be made is through mandatory corporate social responsibility to create a pilot project with small-scale industries in eastern Indonesia that process goods locally to be exported through JIIPE. The pilot project can be done with business-to-business or business-to-government cooperation which enhances community development and corporate assistance to promote export-oriented industries in Eastern Indonesia. The initiation of a pilot project that is successfully implemented hopefully will stimulate other projects and industries and boost Eastern Indonesia's economic growth. This cooperation can also be beneficial for JIIPE itself by strengthening its role as a hub for East Indonesia. \n",
      "(9628) \n",
      "(9631) Local Labor Enhancement\n",
      "(9753) The fastest way to answer the mismatched problem of local labor skills is to provide short courses, certifications, and training programs for local labor and vocational students that align with the industry’s requirements. This effort is urgent and crucial to fulfill the mandatory requirements of 60% local labor in the SEZ. JIIPE as the area developer should lead the initiatives that connect the local educational institutions with the requirements of industries in the area. Educational institutions should be agile and proactive in providing substantial training, courses, and certifications to comply with the requirements of the industries. The government should also support the resources needed to do that and actively monitor and evaluate the gap in the supply and demand of local labor\n",
      "(9753) \n",
      "(9756) Link and Match\n",
      "(9886) The responsibility to match the local labor with the industry’s requirements not only fell upon the local institutions but also the industries themselves. The government through JIIPE should collaborate closely with industries to develop the local workforce. This can be done through job training, internships, and direct recruitment programs for local vocational students within the industries. This is important to prepare the local labor to not only have the theories knowledge but also have hands-on experience in the field. The direct recruitment programs can also ensure that students can have stable jobs upon their graduation and ensure that the industry will have suitable labor for their activity. Therefore, this can accelerate job absorption and fulfilment of the required 60% local labor, whilst also providing the industry with a sufficient workforce.\n",
      "(9886) \n",
      "(9888) Community Development\n",
      "(10014) This strategy aims to compensate for the local community’s loss due to the development of Gresik SEZ. While its development adhered to the region’s plan, the land use changed and the development impacted local communities that already live and work there, especially the fish farmers. Several news and papers reported that there are disputes on land acquisition and damage to local fishponds, that need to be resolved immediately. Besides the compensation for those losses, there should also be other compensation in terms of community development. The government and JIIPE should facilitate local communities who are willing to switch careers that are still in line with SEZ activities. Community development thus can ensure that native communities can also participate and benefit from economic activity in the area.\n",
      "(10014) \n",
      "(10017) Long term Recommendation\n",
      "(10019) Workforce Preparation\n",
      "(10114) To make this special economic zone a success in the long run, preparing the local workforce is fundamental. This can be done by increasing the number of vocational schools and universities with programs that match the needs of the industries in the SEZ. For example, training in logistics, engineering, manufacturing, and green technology will help locals gain the skills needed for the jobs available now and in the future. By doing this, we can reduce reliance on workers from outside the region and give local people better opportunities to grow and contribute to the economy.\n",
      "(10114) \n",
      "(10116) Strengthening Partnerships\n",
      "(10204) Building strong partnerships is key to helping the Gresik SEZ reach its full potential. Collaboration between industries, schools, and universities should be strengthened to improve skills, foster innovation, and create a talent pipeline. At the same time, specialized industries like automotive, pharmaceuticals, or renewable energy should be attracted by investing in advanced infrastructure and smart technologies. Setting up innovation centers can help industries stay competitive and adapt to future challenges. Finally, focusing on green practices will make Gresik SEZ more attractive to global investors who care about sustainability.\n",
      "(10204) \n",
      "(10207) Develop Regional Linkages\n",
      "(10301) Developing strong connections with local industries is key to creating a sustainable industrial ecosystem within the Gresik SEZ. By promoting backward and forward linkages, the SEZ can integrate local industries into its supply chain. For example, an automotive factory within the SEZ should prioritize the supply of wheels or other components from nearby suppliers. This can foster regional linkages and reduce reliance on imports and footloose industries. Therefore, this strategy will not only strengthen the local economy but also ensure that surrounding regions benefit from the SEZ’s growth, contributing to a more balanced development.\n",
      "(10301) \n",
      "(10303) Equitable Planning\n",
      "(10397) While the SEZ is doing well in terms of economic growth and environmental efforts, it’s important not to overlook the social aspect. Some groups, like local fish farmers who were displaced or workers who haven’t been trained for SEZ jobs, are being left behind. The government needs to look beyond just economic performance and think about fairness and inclusivity. Programs to reskill workers, provide affordable housing, and support vulnerable communities will ensure that everyone benefits from the SEZ’s progress. This way, development isn’t just about numbers but about improving the community’s quality of life.\n",
